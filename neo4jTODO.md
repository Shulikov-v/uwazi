# Neo4j Migration

## Needs to be done

### Templates

- Make selects, multiselects, etc. actual connections to the source of the property (currently named 'content')
- Replace this connection name ('content') with something more semantic like "source", "contentSource", etc.
- Change DictionaryValues id property to _id.
